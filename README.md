- 👋 Hi, I’m @lhperreault
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and business
- I’m currently learning python, sql, r, and JMP. Always looking for extra work to do. My repositories are meant to display my work. 
- I’m looking all the time for tips to make my work faster or methods and practices that can add more value to my skill set.
